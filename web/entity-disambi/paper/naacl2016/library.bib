The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.},

We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global log- bilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word co- occurrence matrix, rather than on the en- tire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. On a recent word analogy task our model obtains 75{\%} accuracy, an improvement of 11{\%} over Mikolov et al. (2013). It also outperforms related word vector models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition.},

abstract = {Recent trends suggest that neural-network-inspired word embedding models outperform traditional count-based distributional models on word similarity and analogy detection tasks. We reveal that much of the performance gains of word embeddings are due to certain system design choices and hyperparameter optimizations, rather than the embedding algorithms themselves. Furthermore, we show that these modifications can be transferred to traditional distributional models, yielding similar gains. In contrast to prior reports, we observe mostly local or insignificant performance differences between the methods, with no global advantage to any single approach over the others.},

Damia is inspired by the Web 2.0 mashup phenomenon. It consists of (1) a browser-based user-interface that allows for the specification of data mashups as data flowfgraphs using a set of operators, (2) a server with an execution engine, as well as (3) APIs for searching, debugging, executing and managing mashups. Damia offers a framework and functionality for dynamic entity resolution, streaming and other higher value features particularly important in the enterprise domain. Damia is currently in perpetual beta in the IBM Intranet. In this demonstration, we showcase the creation and execution of several enterprise data mashups, thereby illustrating the architecture and features of the overall Damia system.},

abstract = {The DBpedia project is a community effort to extract structured information from Wikipedia and to make this information accessible on the Web. The resulting DBpedia knowledge base currently describes over 2.6 million entities. For each of these entities, DBpedia defines a globally unique identifier that can be dereferenced over the Web into a rich RDF description of the entity, including human-readable definitions in 30 languages, relationships to other resources, classifications in four concept hierarchies, various facts as well as data-level links to other Web data sources describing the entity. Over the last year, an increasing number of data publishers have begun to set data-level links to DBpedia resources, making DBpedia a central interlinking hub for the emerging Web of Data. Currently, the Web of interlinked data sources around DBpedia provides approximately 4.7 billion pieces of information and covers domains such as geographic information, people, companies, films, music, genes, drugs, books, and scientific publications. This article describes the extraction of the DBpedia knowledge base, the current status of interlinking DBpedia with other data sources on the Web, and gives an overview of applications that facilitate the Web of Data around DBpedia.},

@article{Mizoguchi2008,
abstract = {This article presents YAGO, a large ontology with high coverage and precision. YAGO has been automatically derived from Wikipedia and WordNet. It comprises entities and relations, and currently contains more than 1.7 million entities and 15 million facts. These include the taxonomic Is-A hierarchy as well as semantic relations between entities. The facts for YAGO have been extracted from the category system and the infoboxes of Wikipedia and have been combined with taxonomic relations from WordNet. Type checking techniques help us keep YAGO’s precision at 95{\%}—as proven by an extensive evaluation study. YAGO is based on a clean logical model with a decidable consistency. Furthermore, it allows representing n-ary relations in a natural way while maintaining compatibility with RDFS. A powerful query model facilitates access to YAGO’s data.},

It represents a vast investment of manual effort and judgment: a huge, constantly evolving tapestry of concepts and relations that is being applied to a host of tasks. This article provides a comprehensive description of this work. It focuses on research that extracts and makes use of the concepts, relations, facts and descriptions found in Wikipedia, and organizes the work into four broad categories: applying Wikipedia to natural language processing; using it to facilitate information retrieval and information extraction; and as a resource for ontology building. The article addresses how Wikipedia is being used as is, how it is being improved and adapted, and how it is being combined with other structures to create entirely new resources. We identify the research groups and individuals involved, and how their work has developed in the last few years. We provide a comprehensive list of the open-source software they have produced.},

In such settings, the lack of linguistic features and sparse lexical context result in a high degree of ambiguity and sharp performance drops of nearly 50{\%} in the accuracy of conventional NED systems. We handle these challenges by developing a model of user-interest with respect to a personal knowledge context; and Wikipedia, a particularly well-established and reliable knowledge base, is used to instantiate the procedure. We conduct systematic evaluations using individuals' posts from Twitter, YouTube, and Flickr and demonstrate that our novel technique is able to achieve substantial performance gains beyond state-of-the-art NED methods.},

abstract = {Integration of Web services from different Web sites has brought new creativity and functionality to Web applications. These integration technologies, called mashup or mixup, have made a shift in Web service development and created a new generation of widely popular and successful Web services such as Google Maps API and YouTube Data API. However, the integration is limited to the Web sites that provide the open Web service APIs, and currently, most existing Web sites do not provide Web services. In this paper, we present a method to integrate the general Web applications. For this purpose, we propose a Web information extraction method to generate the virtual Web service functions from Web applications at client side. Our implementation shows that the general Web applications can be also integrated easily.},

A step towards this goal is to bring more structured annotations to existing documents using common vocabularies or ontologies. Semi-structured texts such as scientific, medical or news articles as well as forum and archived mailing list threads or (micro-)blog posts can hence be semantically annotated. Named Entity (NE) extractors play a key role for extracting structured information by identifying features, also called entities, and by linking them to other web resources by means of typed inferences. In this article, we propose a thorough evaluation of five popular Linked Data entity extractors which expose APIs: AlchemyAPI, DBPedia Spotlight, Extractiv, OpenCalais and Zemanta. We present NERD, an evaluation framework we have developed and the results of a controlled evaluation performed by human beings that consists in assigning a Boolean value to three criteria: entity detection, entity type and entity disambiguation.},

(2) Unit vectorをquery logから検出し作る
→正規化され全てのベクトル値は0～1までになる
(3) Term vectorとunit vectorを統合しconcept vectorを作成する

* Unit vectorはquery logから生成されており、interestingnessをcaptureしている。
* term vectorはTF-IDFをコーパスに対して取っており、relevanceをcaptureしている。

@techreport{export:156194,
abstract = {<p>This paper presents a method for entity disambiguation, one of the most
substantial tasks for machines to understand text in natural languages. In a
natural language, terms have ambiguity, e.g. "Barcelona" usually means a Spanish
city but it can also refer to a professional football club. In our work, we
utilize a probabilistic taxonomy that is as rich as our mental world in terms of
the concepts of worldly facts it contains. We then employ a naive Bayes
probabilistic model to disambiguate a term by identifying its related terms in
the same document. Specifically, our method consists of two steps: clustering
related terms and conceptualizing the cluster using the probabilistic taxonomy.
We cluster related terms probabilistically instead of using any threshold-based
deterministic clustering approach. Our method automatically adjusts the relevance
weight between two terms by taking the topic of the document into consideration.
This enables us to perform clustering without using a sensitive, predefined
threshold. Then, we conceptualize all possible clusters using the probabilistic
taxonomy, and we aggregate the probabilities of each concept to find the most
likely one. Experimental results show that our method outperforms threshold-based
methods with optimally set thresholds as well as several gold standard approaches
for entity disambiguation.</p>},

We investigate Random Forests (RF) as a low-cost alternative algorithm to Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) (the de facto standard of web-search ranking). We demonstrate that it yields surprisingly accurate ranking results | comparable to or better than GBRT. We combine the two algorithms by rst learning a ranking function with RF and using it as initialization for GBRT. We refer to this setting as iGBRT. Following a recent discussion by Li et al. (2007), we show that the results of iGBRT can be improved upon even further when the web-search ranking task is cast as classi cation instead of regression. We provide an upper bound of the Expected Reciprocal Rank (Chapelle et al., 2009) in terms of classi cation error and demonstrate that iGBRT outperforms GBRT and RF on the Microsoft Learning to Rank and Yahoo Ranking Competition data sets with surprising consistency.},

@inproceedings{Yazdani2013,
abstract = {We propose a method for computing semantic relatedness between words or texts by using knowledge from hypertext encyclopedias such as Wikipedia. A network of concepts is built by filtering the encyclopedias articles, each concept corresponding to an article. Two types of weighted links between concepts are considered: one based on hyperlinks between the texts of the articles, and another one based on the lexical similarity between them. We propose and implement an efficient random walk algorithm that computes the distance between nodes, and then between sets of nodes, using the visiting probability from one (set of) node(s) to another. Moreover, to make the algorithm tractable, we propose and validate empirically two truncation methods, and then use an embedding space to learn an approximation of visiting probability. To evaluate the proposed distance, we apply our method to four important tasks in natural language processing: word similarity, document similarity, document clustering and classification, and ranking in information retrieval. The performance of the method is state-of-the-art or close to it for each task, thus demonstrating the generality of the knowledge resource. Moreover, using both hyperlinks and lexical similarity links improves the scores with respect to a method using only one of them, because hyperlinks bring additional real-world knowledge not captured by lexical similarity. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

For maximal inter- operability, we release our resource as a set of flat line-based text files, lexicographically sorted and encoded with UTF-8. These files capture joint probability distributions underlying concepts (we use the terms article, concept andWikipedia URL interchangeably) and associated snippets of text, aswell as other features that can come in handy whenworkingwithWikipedia articles and related information.},

abstract = {Pervasive web and social networks are becoming part of everyone's life. Users through their activities on these networks are leaving traces of their expertise, interests and personalities. With the advances in Web mining and user modeling techniques it is possible to leverage the user social network activity history to extract the semantics of user-generated content. In this work we explore various techniques for constructing user profiles based on the content they publish on social networks. We further show that one of the advantages of maintaining social network user profiles is to provide the context for better understanding of microposts. We propose and experimentally evaluate different approaches for entity disambiguation in social networks based on syntactic and semantic features on top of two different social networks: a general-interest network (i.e., Twitter) and a domain-specific network (i.e., StackOverflow). We demonstrate how disambiguation accuracy increases when considering enriched user profiles integrating content from both social networks.},

abstract = {Existing techniques for disambiguating named entities in text mostly focus on Wikipedia as a target catalog of entities. Yet for many types of entities, such as restaurants and cult movies, relational databases exist that contain far more extensive information than Wikipedia. This paper introduces a new task, called Open-Database Named-Entity Disambiguation (Open-DB NED), in which a system must be able to resolve named entities to symbols in an arbitrary database, without requiring labeled data for each new database. We introduce two techniques for Open-DB NED, one based on distant supervision and the other based on domain adaptation. In experiments on two domains, one with poor coverage by Wikipedia and the other with near-perfect coverage, our Open-DB NED strategies outperform a state-of-the-art Wikipedia NED system by over 25{\%} in accuracy.},

It explains how machine learning can be used to identify significant terms within unstructured text, and enrich it with links to the appropriate Wikipedia articles. The resulting link detector and disambiguator performs very well, with recall and precision of almost 75{\%}. This performance is constant whether the system is evaluated on Wikipedia articles or "real world" documents. This work has implications far beyond enriching documents with explanatory links. It can provide structured knowledge about any unstructured fragment of text. Any task that is currently addressed with bags of words - indexing, clustering, retrieval, and summarization to name a few - could use the techniques described here to draw on a vast network of concepts and semantics.},

abstract = {Entity disambiguation with a knowledge base becomes increasingly popular in the NLP community. In this paper, we employ Freebase as the knowledge base, which contains significantly more entities than Wikipedia and others. While huge in size, Freebase lacks context for most entities, such as the descriptive text and hyperlinks in Wikipedia, which are useful for disambiguation. Instead, we leverage two features of Freebase, namely the naturally disambiguated mention phrases (aka aliases) and the rich taxonomy, to perform disambiguation in an iterative manner. Specifically, we explore both generative and discriminative models for each iteration. Experiments on 2, 430, 707 English sentences and 33, 743 Freebase entities show the effectiveness of the two features, where 90{\%} accuracy can be reached without any labeled data. We also show that discriminative models with proposed split training strategy is robust against over fitting problem, and constantly outperforms the generative ones.},

abstract = {Increasingly large numbers of situational applications are being created by enterprise business users as a by-product of solving day-to-day problems. In efforts to address the demand for such applications, corporate IT is moving toward Web 2.0 architectures. In particular, the corporate intranet is evolving into a platform of readily accessible data and services where communities of business users can assemble and deploy situational applications. Damia is a web style data integration platform being developed to address the data problem presented by such applications, which often access and combine data from a variety of sources. Damia allows business users to quickly and easily create data mashups that combine data from desktop, web, and traditional IT sources into feeds that can be consumed by AJAX, and other types of web applications. This paper describes the key features and design of Damia's data integration engine, which has been packaged with Mashup Hub, an enterprise feed server currently available for download on IBM alphaWorks. Mashup Hub exposes Damia's data integration capabilities in the form of a service that allows users to create hosted data mashups.},

The paper also shows how the two methods can be combined into a system able to automatically enrich a text with links to encyclopedic knowledge. Given an input document, the system identifies the important concepts in the text and automatically links these concepts to the corresponding Wikipedia pages. Evaluations of the system show that the automatic annotations are reliable and hardly distinguishable from manual annotations.},

abstract = {Applying natural language processing for mining and intelligent information access to tweets (a form of microblog) is a challenging, emerging research area. Unlike carefully authored news text and other longer content, tweets pose a number of new challenges, due to their short, noisy, context-dependent, and dynamic nature. Information extraction from tweets is typically performed in a pipeline, comprising consecutive stages of language identification, tokenisation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition and entity disambiguation (e.g. with respect to DBpedia). In this work, we describe a new Twitter entity disambiguation dataset, and conduct an empirical analysis of named entity recognition and disambiguation, investigating how robust a number of state-of-the-art systems are on such noisy texts, what the main sources of error are, and which problems should be further investigated to improve the state of the art.},

The performance of standard NLP tools is severely degraded on tweets. This paper addresses this issue by re-building the NLP pipeline beginning with part-of-speech tagging, through chunking, to named-entity recognition. Our novel T-NER system doubles F1 score compared with the Stanford NER system. T-NER leverages the redundancy inherent in tweets to achieve this performance, using LabeledLDA to exploit Freebase dictionaries as a source of distant supervision. LabeledLDA outperforms co- training, increasing F1 by 25{\%} over ten com- mon entity types.},

Existing systems for flexible visualization of this kind of data require manual specification of the possible visualization roles for each data attribute. When the schema is large and unfamiliar, this requirement inhibits exploratory visualization by requiring a costly up-front data integration step. To eliminate this step, we propose an automatic technique for mapping data attributes to visualization attributes. We formulate this as a schema matching problem, finding appropriate paths in the data model for each required visualization attribute in a visualization template.},
